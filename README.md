# TodoList [![Symfony insight Badge](https://insight.symfony.com/projects/6b1873c7-6f00-4dff-a2d9-dba82b504a04/analyses/13)]

## Description

This project is the 8th project of the [Developer PHP / Symfony](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/59-developpeur-dapplication-php-symfony) formation of [Openclassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/).

The first objective of this project was to **migrate a Symfony 3.1 project directly to a newer version**, here my choice fell on **the latest Symfony LTS, 6.1**.
The second objective after the corrections that we needed the migration was to implement an architecture respecting the SOLID principles through a refactoring
The third goal was to implement **unit and functional testing via [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.5/)** and fix/add some features.
Throughout the project, it was necessary to carry out a **project quality and performance audit, via [Blackfire](https://blackfire.io/) , [Symfony Insight](https://insight.symfony.com /)** mainly and with phpstan locally.
